								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>That Which is Nameless</em> just made it back from editing.  Now I have to go through it and see just how much blood there is on the floor.  That should be an interesting process!  In another few days, I&#8217;ll post an update to the book and see how things go!  I&#8217;m thinking that I have another round of free promotion days available to the run through.</p>
<p>Work on <em>The Empty</em> is coming along, but slowly.  I&#8217;m having difficulty finding a moment to sit down and write.  Maybe I&#8217;ll have to do some of that over my lunch hour . . . Ah well, there&#8217;s never enough time!</p>
<p>UPDATE:  Well, I&#8217;m 27 pages into merging the edits and I&#8217;ve conclude that comma rules are my bane!  Wow, I&#8217;d say a good 95% of the things that needed to be fixed were comma issues.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A short while back I spotted a reference to the <a href="http://litreactor.com/events/scare-us">Scare Us</a> event over at Lit Reactor. To tell you the truth, I hadn&#8217;t heard of Lit Reactor prior to then and I&#8217;m not entirely sure what to make of the site. Before I make a final call on them I&#8217;ll have to try taking advantage of some more of their resources. Either way, their event provided the perfect avenue for me to take a break from (read that as procrastinate on ) my current project and give something a less involved a shot. Hence, <em>A Thousand Cuts</em> was born. The story is right around 3200 words and seems to grow a little bit every time I run through and edit.</p>
<p>I decided to take a slightly different approach to the tools I&#8217;m using this time. Rather than use <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a> I went with <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html">reStructuredText</a> and <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">DocUtils</a> directly. As usual, everything is stuffed into a git repository to make tracking changes simpler.  The advantage of doing things this way is the that I can use the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/tools.html#rst2odt-py">rst2odt.py</a> front-end to produce a nice OpenOffice document.  From that it is really easy to produce the .doc file expected in the competition.  I&#8217;ll have to take a look at the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/sandbox/rst2pdf/README.html">rst2pdf</a> at somepoint as well.  It looks like it could save me a step or two in the final build process and maybe eliminate the need for OpenOffice to be involved at all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be getting back to the <em>The Empty</em> soon though.  I can&#8217;t very well let that story fall of the edge of the world.  Also, <i>That Which is Nameless</i> is about shortly to be going through another round of editing.  When that is finished up, I&#8217;m thinking about getting it into a print version.  When the <a href="http://litreactor.com/events/scare-us">Scare Us</a> event is over with, I&#8217;m thinking about doing something with <em>A Thousand Cuts</em>.  I might turn it into a stand alone epub and push it to Amazon . . . </p>
<p>UPDATE: So much for thinking I had the final draft.  There will always be something to fix or do better in a story, no matter how clean you think you have it!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spent a few hours today writing on <em>The Empty</em> and I would have to say that there&#8217;s probably too much <a href="http://lovecraftzine.com/" title="Lovecraft" target="_blank">Lovecraft</a> in my present reading diet.  Hopefully Jack and the creature from Outside don&#8217;t turn out to be overly sadistic.  On the other hand, how do you prevent the actions of a creature that has a hunger for life itself from looking like pure evil? Do I really want it to not look evil?  Ah fun!  In any event, the text just hit 13685 words and I&#8217;ve written the first actual death scene.  This one was a &#8216;red shirt&#8217; moment though, not a character that you would actually care about.  I&#8217;m trying to decide who to kill off next . . .</p>
<p>Heck, I&#8217;m probably giving away too much information as it is!  This is all still a rough draft.  If I were to take <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2067160.On_Writing" title="On Writing" target="_blank">King&#8217;s words in On Writing</a> to heart, you wouldn&#8217;t hear anything about this little tale until much later in the game.  I&#8217;m not sure that I can really write that way though.  I just have to talk about what I&#8217;m writing.  It helps me think through what happens next.  Still, I can&#8217;t give away all the secrets or there wouldn&#8217;t be a story.  Although, I might write up that &#8216;red shirt&#8217; moment from the victim&#8217;s perspective, just to drum up a little interest.  We&#8217;ll see . . . If anyone is interested, leave a comment . . . I might still write it up for the fun of it.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I commented about my own writing so, I though it was about time that I gave an update on <em>The Empty.</em>  The book is taking me a touch longer to write without the constant pressure to churn out words you find with <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" title="NaNoWriMo">NaNoWriMo</a>.  Of course, the fact that I have a cat sitting on my chest as I write this doesn&#8217;t really help things.  Integra can be a bit of an attention hog when she want&#8217;s to be.  Ah well, that&#8217;s the way of things when living with a cat.  As <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/r/robertahe390442.html" title="Women and Cats">Heinlein</a> said, I should just get used to the idea.</p>
<p>Well, enough of that for now.  I need to turn 11000 words into 12000 or so.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> I didn&#8217;t quite make 12000 but 11893 is not a bad stopping point.  Especially if you consider that it was about 1 in the morning when I stopped there.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The sale period is over now and a total of 538 of you have downloaded the book: 488 on the US site, 44 on the UK site, and 6 on the German site.  Also, the book has a new review!  YAY!  Not all roses though.  To tell you the truth, I&#8217;m glad to know at least someone out of the roughly 1000 total people who have downloaded the book is reading it and willing to say something about their experience.  </p>
<p>Also, an update on <em>The Empty</em>.  The text just passed the 7000 word mark last night!  I&#8217;m finding that my attempts at outlining/planning where this story should be going in more than a cursory manner are bearing no resemblance to the actual flow of the story.  That feels a little frustrating when I look back at what I was planning to write about and find that instead, I have three new characters to juggle and the potential for a new side plot that.  Of course, that means I have three new characters to juggle and a new side plot to figure out.  Such is life.  </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a new read through and some editing also comes a new cover!  The old cover was something I threw together in a very short time using the <a href="http://www.gimp.org">Gimp</a> but don&#8217;t hold my bumbling against them. Let&#8217;s just say that my writing is much better than my skill with a graphics editing tool. Some of my friends, on the other hand, can do a dang good job with a mouse! This version still needs a little tweaking, at least that&#8217;s what I was told, so there may be some minor differences between what I&#8217;m posting and the final version. Still, this is definitely eye catching.</p>
<p><a href="http://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/that_which_is_nameless600x900.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-98" title="That Which is Nameless" src="http://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/that_which_is_nameless600x900-200x300.png" alt="That Which is Nameless - Cover, Large" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/that_which_is_nameless600x900-200x300.png 200w, https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/that_which_is_nameless600x900.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></a></p>
<p>YEAH!  That works a good deal better than the orange monstrosity that I&#8217;ve had on the book until now.  As soon as I get the final version, I&#8217;ll be updating the book on Amazon.  This version will have a significantly cleaner read to go along with the slick new cover.</p>
<p>For anyone following with the next book.  It&#8217;s coming along, if slowly. I&#8217;ve been able to beef it up to about 4700 words now, which is just barely enough to introduce you to the story.  Life, as always, can be a bit of a pain.  I hope to find time and energy to get some real writing done soon.  I wrote the first one during a <a title="National Novel Writing Month" href="http://nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">NanoWrimo</a> so you would think I could pull the second one off in similar time.  HA!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve started work on a follow up book to the <em><a title="That Which is Nameless" href="http://www.amazon.com/That-Which-is-Nameless-ebook/dp/B005GBEHG6/" target="_blank">That Which is Nameless</a>.</em>  My current working title for the book is  <em>The Empty</em>.  I had hoped to work through the text during <a title="National Novel Writing Month" href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/" target="_blank">NaNoWrimo</a> in December of last year.  Unfortunately, life and the day job conspired against me on that front.  So, I&#8217;m working through things at a slightly slower, but hopefully reasonably consistent pace.  Right now, I have about 2870 words committed to the git repository I have the novel in.  Not sure what I&#8217;m going to do for a cover just yet though.   The one for <em><a title="That Which is Nameless" href="http://www.amazon.com/That-Which-is-Nameless-ebook/dp/B005GBEHG6/" target="_blank">That Which is Nameless</a></em> is a little on the garish side, I&#8217;ll be trying for something a little better this time around.  I may have to release an updated version to <em><a title="That Which is Nameless" href="http://www.amazon.com/That-Which-is-Nameless-ebook/dp/B005GBEHG6/" target="_blank">That Which is Nameless</a> </em>with a better cover after I finish <em>The Empty.</em></p>
