<p>This started out with a picture I found over on <a href="https://pixabay.com/en/pink-hair-hairstyle-women-1450045/">Pixabay</a> that seemed like it might be interesting to give a shot. There were a couple of things I tried differently here than than the <a href="https://chrissalch.com/wp-1488950812642-jpg/">last painting I did</a>. Namely, I used a proportional divider to and charcoal to lay the image out on the canvas rather than a tracing, and used WMOs again rather than acrylic.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I&#8217;m reasonably certain that I don&#8217;t like Golden Open acrylics. They seem to get into this &#8220;tacky&#8221; stage that persists for a very long time and makes it very easy to mistakenly pull up previous layers of paint. I <em>might</em> be able to get used to them and figure out how to use them, but more than likely I&#8217;m going to stick with the oils or straight acrylics instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s another one that I spent a huge chunk of time on:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-839 size-large" src="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/wp-1488864298755-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="497" height="373" /></p>
<p>This one turned out amazing, but took me a month of painting sessions to finish up! It will likely be a while before I do another stint quite that long on a single piece.  Still, I&#8217;m happy with the way it turned out and will hopefully be able to get this one framed pretty soon.</p>
<p>On to writing!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had <em>The Erasable Man</em> back for nearly a month now and I&#8217;m about half way through my re-read after editing. The current plan is to finish this read up and send if off for a second round of beta reads. I might look into a follow up editing via <a href="http://silviasreading.webs.com/">Silvia&#8217;s Reading Corner</a> if I have the spare cash by then. We&#8217;ll just have to see.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>About Midnight last night I completed my first foray into water mixable oil paints, in particular <a href="http://www.lukas.eu/berlin_wassermischbare_oelfarben/?L=2">Lukas Berlin</a> paints. My &#8220;studio&#8221; is presently a garage with little to no ventilation and no good means of adding any so standard oil paints and traditional thinners/solvents are quite out of the question. Plus, the idea of being able to clean up with little more than water, oil, and soap is very attractive. They have a longer drying time than Acrylics, which is nice for somethings but kind of annoying for others. In particular, I now have to figure out where the heck to keep this thing until it drys completely!</p>
<p>Overall, I think the paints are an interesting alternative to Acrylics. I also have the distinct impression that the small tubes of Berlin paint will go a good deal further than a similar sized acrylic tube. If you decide to play with them, make sure to pick up a bottle of Lukas&#8217; modified water mixable linseed oil to go along with your set. They say that you can use water to thin the paints, which is true, but everything I&#8217;ve read seems to indicate that water thinning can be a hit or miss prospect. The modified linseed oil seems to do the trick quite well though!</p>
<p>On to the good part! This painting started I <a href="https://pmp-art.com/sandie-bell/gallery/180021/frosty-morning">shot by Sandie Bell</a> over on <a href="https://pmp-art.com/">Paint My Photo</a> as a reference. If you&#8217;re a photographer or an artist I&#8217;d recommend giving the site a chance. They have a large collection of royalty free photos for use as reference material for physical medium artwork (i.e. paint, pencils, pastels, etc. but no digital stuff). You need an account to login and see the reference, but they&#8217;re free and I haven&#8217;t run into anything overly obnoxious with the site as yet.</p>
<p>The painting itself took me three sessions to complete. My schedule allows for two to three hours in a late evening session during the week. Since the last session was a Friday night, I&#8217;ve probably got about eight-ish hours in the painting itself.</p>
<div id="attachment_783" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-783" class="wp-image-783" src="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FrostyMorningBoats1stNight1024.jpeg" width="800" height="608" /><p id="caption-attachment-783" class="wp-caption-text">1st Night Progress</p></div>
<p>I did the base drawing by tracing over an enlarged printout of the photo with some carbon paper underneath. That gave me some very light lines to start with that I went over with white charcoal pencil to make them more visible. My tendency to write with an extremely light touch and a dark canvas left them almost invisible otherwise. That first night I had a good handle on the blacks (all chromatic), shoreline, water, and the main boat in the center.</p>
<div id="attachment_782" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FrostyMorningBoats2ndNight1024.jpeg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-782" class="wp-image-782" src="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FrostyMorningBoats2ndNight1024.jpeg" width="800" height="633" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-782" class="wp-caption-text">2nd Night Progress</p></div>
<p>The second night, I finished off five of the other boats and did a little rework of the water and shoreline in the background. This is where I discovered that the Berlin paints become touch dry amazingly fast. From what I&#8217;ve been told, I was expecting them to still be pretty &#8220;damp&#8221; but it turns out they were too dry to work on their own. A little extra medium (modified linseed oil) and paint seemed to do the trick though. As a note, it was only the paints on the canvas that were dry, the stuff on my palette was still pretty workable.</p>
<div id="attachment_784" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-784" class="wp-image-784" src="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/FrostyMorningBoats1024.jpeg" width="800" height="614" /><p id="caption-attachment-784" class="wp-caption-text">Final Night Progress</p></div>
<p>And here it is, finished! I had a little trouble with some of the thinner paint globs on my palette being drying this time. Of course, I wasn&#8217;t doing anything special to keep them from drying out so that is probably to be expected. Since this was on a stretched canvas rather than a canvas board, I took all the left over paint and mixed up a big glob of &#8220;palette mud&#8221; and used it as an edge cover.  Unfortunately, no I have to protect the thing for the three months or so it takes for the paint to cure enough to varnish. Which is why I&#8217;ll probably be doing acrylics for a while, at least until I can come up with a good strategy for dealing with drying oil paintings.</p>
<p>On other notes, TEM is coming along nicely.  I&#8217;ve been working with a beta reader I ran into over on Good Reads doing a manuscript exchange. So far, we&#8217;re about half way through both works and well on the way to getting this editing cycle finished. There&#8217;s also a scheduled beta read with a professional editor (<a href="http://silviasreading.webs.com/">Silvia&#8217;s Reading Corner</a>) that should provide some valuable insights as well. If all of that goes well, then it&#8217;s on to figuring out a more formalized publishing strategy. So, still a ways out, making progress!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a fun one that came out of following along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HoneyBmama/videos">The Art Sherpa</a>. In particular, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6HfTmd_Mkg">Blue Door</a> tutorial and follow up. I got it up to this point:</p>
<p><a href="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161217_000841Web.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-768" src="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161217_000841Web.jpg" width="800" height="619" /></a></p>
<p>Then took a shot at the stucco effect, minus the stucco effect medium. Mainly because I didn&#8217;t happen to have any on hand.  Well, that got a little away from me though.</p>
<p><a href="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161217_011048Web.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-770" src="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161217_011048Web.jpg" width="800" height="595" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was a few days ago. Tonight I re-added a few of the bricks and went on with the second part of the tutorial. (Temporally it was the first part, but what the hey ;). In the end it came out about like so:</p>
<p><a href="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161220_222523Web.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-769" src="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/20161220_222523Web.jpg" width="800" height="609" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On other topics, the beta read of <em>The Erasable Man</em> is coming along nicely, but slowly. If all goes well, the book will be ready for publishing sometime early next year.</p>

As of Friday this week, I have ~50600 words of TEM edited (that&#8217;s relying on <a href="https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php?show=new#section-compile">Scrivener&#8217;s compile filter</a> to pick out the completed sections). There&#8217;s probably about 10~15k left to edit and a few new scenes to add before I&#8217;m willing to call this version done, which will hopefully be sometime in the next month or so.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s about an hour to two hours a day that I can effectively write, assuming all the stars align properly.  In actuality, that&#8217;s broken up between my bus ride into work in the morning and what time I can prune out of my lunch hour. By the evening ride home, my brain isn&#8217;t very usable for working on the written word.  But, I&#8217;ve discovered something else that is just different enough from writing (words and code) to not add to my exhaustion and still in the creative vein.</p>
<p>About a week ago, my wife pointed out a <a href="https://www.paintingwithatwist.com/northaustin">Painting With A Twist</a> event happening on a weekend and we decided to give it a shot. She&#8217;d been to several of these before hand and I hadn&#8217;t picked up a paint brush since middle school. That led to this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet aligncenter" data-lang="en">

<p><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Which finally turned into:</p>
<p><a href="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Pwt-optimized.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-759" src="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Pwt-optimized.jpg" alt="pwt-optimized" width="800" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>It was fun to play around with and got me thinking &#8230; Overall, the picture wasn&#8217;t bad, but I wasn&#8217;t too happy with the polka dot ground. The entire process wasn&#8217;t that tricky to pull off either, six colors of paint (if I remember correctly &#8230;) two brushes, canvas, an easel, something to use as a palette, and a little time. More or less. So, I blew some money at the local craft store and came up with this:</p>
<p><a href="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/crazy-talk-optimized.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-757" src="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/crazy-talk-optimized.jpg" alt="crazy-talk-optimized" width="800" height="579" /></a></p>
<p>Yeah, I was even less happy with that one, the water effect didn&#8217;t quite work out and I overdid the clouds a bit, but it was a start. Now I had the equipment and decided to play around a bit and spend a little too much time watching Bob Ross on Netflix.</p>
<p>That led to:</p>
<p><a href="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/winter-mountains-optimized.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-761" src="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/winter-mountains-optimized.jpg" alt="winter-mountains-optimized" width="800" height="583" /></a></p>
<p>And then too:</p>
<p><a href="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/side-waterfall-optimized.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-760" src="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/side-waterfall-optimized.jpg" alt="side-waterfall-optimized" width="800" height="997" /></a></p>
<p>Where my wife thought the waterfall was a little unnatural looking so I did this:</p>
<p><a href="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/forest-waterfall-optimized.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-758" src="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/forest-waterfall-optimized.jpg" alt="forest-waterfall-optimized" width="800" height="1010" /></a></p>
<p>And last night to:</p>
<p><a href="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/balanced-optimized.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-756" src="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/balanced-optimized.jpg" alt="balanced-optimized" width="800" height="631" /></a></p>
<p>Which is sort of based on a Bob Ross composition (finally found the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BobRossInc">channel on YouTube</a> ).  I wouldn&#8217;t call any of it particularly good (heck I&#8217;ve only been playing for a week!) but it&#8217;s interesting to work through and who knows where it will ultimately lead. Plus, it&#8217;s pulling me away from less productive forms of procrastination that were eating into my semi-non-productive time anyhow.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes out for the next update.  My current plan is to have TEM ready to go by late December to Early January. Or at least be well done with this draft by then and handing it off to someone else to edit.  We&#8217;ll see if I make it!</p>
