								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I commented about my own writing so, I though it was about time that I gave an update on <em>The Empty.</em>  The book is taking me a touch longer to write without the constant pressure to churn out words you find with <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" title="NaNoWriMo">NaNoWriMo</a>.  Of course, the fact that I have a cat sitting on my chest as I write this doesn&#8217;t really help things.  Integra can be a bit of an attention hog when she want&#8217;s to be.  Ah well, that&#8217;s the way of things when living with a cat.  As <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/r/robertahe390442.html" title="Women and Cats">Heinlein</a> said, I should just get used to the idea.</p>
<p>Well, enough of that for now.  I need to turn 11000 words into 12000 or so.</p>
<p><b>Update:</b> I didn&#8217;t quite make 12000 but 11893 is not a bad stopping point.  Especially if you consider that it was about 1 in the morning when I stopped there.</p>
