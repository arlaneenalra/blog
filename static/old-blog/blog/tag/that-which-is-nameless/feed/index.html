								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In honor of getting my this site moved onto new hosting, the kindle version of <em><a title="That Which is Nameless" href="http://www.amazon.com/That-Which-is-Nameless-ebook/dp/B005GBEHG6" target="_blank">That Which is Nameless</a> </em>is going to be free this weekend the 18th and 19th!  Here&#8217;s a short excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>That is, until someone tripped one of my traps. Thankfully, it was nothing overly dangerous. I had set up proximity-triggered portals around the room I was staying in, arranged to prevent anyone other than me from finding my door. In theory, anyone who activated one of the portals should have been moved down the walkway by the width of one room, none the wiser. Somewhere in the process of writing out the phrasing I had screwed up. Instead of being moved one door farther down, they were moved one door farther back.</p>
<p>The poor soul spent an hour trying to get away from the door to my room before I found her. She had a downtrodden, frantic look that characterized many of the residents in this hotel. Her eyes were sunken into a gaunt face, and she was generally disheveled in appearance. If I had to make a guess as to her age, I would have said somewhere in her late twenties. I was reasonably sure she had not bathed or changed clothing in some time. She was sitting across the walkway from my door with her body pulled up into the fetal position. Tears were streaming down her face as she sat there, rocking back and forth in fear and desperation.</p>
<p>When she saw me opening the door she screamed and grabbed my legs, holding on for dear life. &#8220;I&#8217;m freaking out! Help me! I&#8217;m trapped here! Please help me!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When you grab a copy, give me a shout-out either here or over on <a title="ArlaneEnalra" href="https://twitter.com/arlaneenalra" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.  Have fun!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s that time again! My novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/That-Which-is-Nameless-ebook/dp/B005GBEHG6" target="_blank"><em>That Which is Nameless</em></a> will be free on Amazon March 1st and 2nd, and  <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/A-Thousand-Cuts-ebook/dp/B00ARIC1GQ" target="_blank">A Thousand Cuts</a></em>, a &#8220;Creepy&#8221; short story I wrote for the <a href="http://litreactor.com/events/scare-us" target="_blank">Scare-Us event at LitReactor</a> will be free March 1st.</p>
<p>Both of these texts have been part of the KDP Select program for the past ninety days and their enrollment is just about to run out.  That means it&#8217;s use it or lose it time for their remaining &#8220;promotion days&#8221; and another give away for you!</p>
<p>If you do pick TWIN or ATC up, I&#8217;d really like to hear what you though of them.  Be sure to drop a comment here, review over on Amazon, or get in touch with me via <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5440871.Chris_Salch">Good Reads.</a></p>
