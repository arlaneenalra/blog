								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I finally had a chance to sit down and go work through the feedback from my editor and work in a few other things I noticed here and there.  (Incidentally, you also might want to checkout <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Happened-My-Space-Vacation-ebook/dp/B00I2WKO22" target="_blank">What Happened On My Space Vacation</a> </em>it&#8217;s targeted at a more young adult audience but is well worth the read.)  Without further ado, here&#8217;s that teaser promised in the title:</p>
<blockquote><p>The temperature in the room started rising as their tempers flared hotter. It wouldn&#8217;t be long before I had to take drastic measures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ladies &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would you give them to an asshole like him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aden! He&#8217;s not an asshole. He&#8217;s &#8230; he&#8217;s none of your business!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ladies &#8230;&#8221; A bead of sweat dripped down the side of my face as more and more heat rolled off the pair. Papers at the edge of my desk were starting to smoke. If they kept this up, I&#8217;d need a new desk, not to mention a new chair, and a new office. The least of my troubles would be another visit with Sheridan. I grabbed a fire extinguisher from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is this asshole? You never tell me anything any&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why should I tell you? It&#8217;s not like you care about&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If all goes well, I&#8217;ll have the full episode posted within the next couple of days and the Episode 7 off to the editor shortly there after.  Now, if only I could find a few moments to rebuild that buffer of episodes again!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally!  I&#8217;ve made my way back through the first ten thousand words of <em>The Erasable Man</em> and have finally caught up with where I was when <em><a title="Teleport Us" href="http://litreactor.com/events/8662/submissions" target="_blank">Teleport-Us</a></em> derailed me.  Now, how to get Zachary Artemas out of his little predicament &#8230; but you don&#8217;t know about that do you.  Here&#8217;s a little snippet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry your little head none about that. I&#8217;m not supposed to kill you unless you&#8217;re difficult,&#8221; said the little man. &#8220;He gave me a note to read to you. It says: Next time it will be you. What&#8217;s that supposed to mean? Next time it will &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Something gurgled and collapsed with a heavy thud. I looked over my shoulder and saw my assailant on the ground, surrounded by dried blood. A zip-tie, pulled tight enough to have embedded itself into the man&#8217;s wrist, bound his hands in the small of his back. Next to the body was a pile of neatly folded skin and two skewered eyeballs sitting on a small ceramic dish pointed directly at me. The eyes had been placed so that they appeared to be looking into my own.</p>
<p>There was no need to check his pulse; the man had been dead for a long time, several hours if the Sun&#8217;s elevation could be trusted. The massive gap in my memory ached like a missing limb. How do you deal with someone who can immobilize you without warning, I thought to myself.</p></blockquote>
<p>The plan is still to release this in an episodic form, with periodic role ups of several episodes.  The main reason I haven&#8217;t pushed out some of the earlier episodes (read that as 2) is that I&#8217;m having trouble finishing them up in a timely manner.  Once I can nail that down, and build up enough of a release backlog to have a spare episode or two waiting in the wings, <em>The Erasable Man</em> will hit the figurative presses.</p>
<p>Anyone have suggestions on a viable platform to publish episodic fiction?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m working through a fist round edit of <em>The Erasable Man</em> and it&#8217;s going somewhat slowly. Of course, going slowly is better than not going at all. My editing rate is about five pages a session give or take a little and I&#8217;m sitting at page nine out twenty three in the printed manuscript. At this rate it will probably take me into next week sometime to actually finish the editing and then a little longer to get through a release process. I&#8217;m still not sure what the best approach on that is. I&#8217;m considering setting up a completely new domain for it or maybe a sub-domain off this one. That might work out better just not quite sure yet. Anyhow, I&#8217;ll keep posting updates here until I get <em>The Erasable Man</em> live somewhere.</p>
