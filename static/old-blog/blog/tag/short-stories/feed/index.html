								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally!  I&#8217;ve made my way back through the first ten thousand words of <em>The Erasable Man</em> and have finally caught up with where I was when <em><a title="Teleport Us" href="http://litreactor.com/events/8662/submissions" target="_blank">Teleport-Us</a></em> derailed me.  Now, how to get Zachary Artemas out of his little predicament &#8230; but you don&#8217;t know about that do you.  Here&#8217;s a little snippet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry your little head none about that. I&#8217;m not supposed to kill you unless you&#8217;re difficult,&#8221; said the little man. &#8220;He gave me a note to read to you. It says: Next time it will be you. What&#8217;s that supposed to mean? Next time it will &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Something gurgled and collapsed with a heavy thud. I looked over my shoulder and saw my assailant on the ground, surrounded by dried blood. A zip-tie, pulled tight enough to have embedded itself into the man&#8217;s wrist, bound his hands in the small of his back. Next to the body was a pile of neatly folded skin and two skewered eyeballs sitting on a small ceramic dish pointed directly at me. The eyes had been placed so that they appeared to be looking into my own.</p>
<p>There was no need to check his pulse; the man had been dead for a long time, several hours if the Sun&#8217;s elevation could be trusted. The massive gap in my memory ached like a missing limb. How do you deal with someone who can immobilize you without warning, I thought to myself.</p></blockquote>
<p>The plan is still to release this in an episodic form, with periodic role ups of several episodes.  The main reason I haven&#8217;t pushed out some of the earlier episodes (read that as 2) is that I&#8217;m having trouble finishing them up in a timely manner.  Once I can nail that down, and build up enough of a release backlog to have a spare episode or two waiting in the wings, <em>The Erasable Man</em> will hit the figurative presses.</p>
<p>Anyone have suggestions on a viable platform to publish episodic fiction?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late Saturday the 30th, almost the 31st, I finally finished reading the last entry to <a href="http://litreactor.com/events/teleport-us" target="_blank">Teleport Us</a> on <a href="http://litreactor.com/" target="_blank">LitReactor</a>.  Over the course of three months, I&#8217;ve read and commented on around 160 short stories.  I&#8217;m not sure of the exact number as some of the stories were pulled after and some before I could get around to reading them.</p>
<p>There is a sense of elation and accomplishment that comes with completing a run like that, and some withdrawal pangs as you realized it&#8217;s all over.  I can honestly say that this competition has devoured almost all of my free time since it was first announced back in January.  Now that it&#8217;s finished, I will have to get to work on some of my own writing again and back to my sorely neglected reading list.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t get around to reading entries before the April 1st deadline, don&#8217;t worry. <a href="http://litreactor.com/events/scare-us" target="_blank">Scare Us</a> from last year is still online with all the entries and comments that went with them, and I&#8217;m certain that Teleport Us will be left up indefinitely as well.  All you have to do is <a href="http://litreactor.com/user/register" target="_blank">get an account on LitReactor</a> to access all of those amazing and sometimes gruesome stories!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A while back I wrote a short story for the <a href="http://litreactor.com/events/scare-us" title="Scare-Us" target="_blank">Scare-Us</a> event over on LitReactor that I&#8217;ve been meaning to do something with for a while.  The premise behind the event was to write a story that involved a unique creature involving at least three deaths set in your hometown.  Here&#8217;s a cover idea that I whipped up to go along with the story.</p>
<div id="attachment_406" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TheFlea25.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-406" class="size-full wp-image-406" alt="Cover for &quot;A Thousand Cuts&quot;" src="//chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TheFlea25.png" width="450" height="675" srcset="https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TheFlea25.png 450w, https://chrissalch.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/TheFlea25-200x300.png 200w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-406" class="wp-caption-text">Cover for &#8220;A Thousand Cuts&#8221;</p></div>
<p>It should be ready to push out to Amazon here in the next couple of days, Until then, here&#8217;s a little taste from the beginning:</p>
<h2>A Thousand Cuts &#8211; <em>Excerpt</em></h2>
<p>We were a happy couple, Catharine and I, moving from an apartment of little more than two rooms, into our very first real home. It wasn&#8217;t much to look at, but it was ours and that was all that really mattered. Catharine&#8217;s parents had known the old widower who lived next door for years and were good friends with his two daughters. When he passed, Mr. Gallinulae willed the property to his children.  Neither of the women could use the place, and Catharine&#8217;s parents knew we were looking for something larger now that we had Julia. They helped us negotiate with the Gallinulae women, now Mrs. Nosopsyllus and Mrs. Pulex, to buy the place.</p>
<p>In the new house, Julia would get a room all to herself. Her crib had occupied the corner of our bedroom for just over year and a half. Now she was going to be sleeping in a &#8220;big girl bed&#8221; in her own room. She was so happy with her newfound independence, and Catharine and I were looking forward to a little more privacy.</p>
<p>Samson, our big orange cat, was as ornery as ever. His royal highness could not stand the indignity of being stuffed into a carrier. He scratched me good across the bridge of my nose, along my right arm, and just about anywhere else he could bring a claw to bear when I forced him into the cage. I&#8217;m sure that obstinate feline damaged the hearing in my right ear with his yowls. If the trip to the new house had been any longer than the five minutes it took to cross town that wild beast would have clawed his way through the carrier&#8217;s thin plastic.</p>
<p>I wonder if that was what started it? Did they smell the fresh blood from my injuries? Did the prospect of fresh food wake them from their slumber?</p>
<h3>UPDATE:</h3>
<p> <em>A Thousand Cuts</em> is in the process of being published on Amazon and should be live in the next 12~24 hours or so.  I&#8217;ve already got the link setup to the right.  Yay!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m working through a fist round edit of <em>The Erasable Man</em> and it&#8217;s going somewhat slowly. Of course, going slowly is better than not going at all. My editing rate is about five pages a session give or take a little and I&#8217;m sitting at page nine out twenty three in the printed manuscript. At this rate it will probably take me into next week sometime to actually finish the editing and then a little longer to get through a release process. I&#8217;m still not sure what the best approach on that is. I&#8217;m considering setting up a completely new domain for it or maybe a sub-domain off this one. That might work out better just not quite sure yet. Anyhow, I&#8217;ll keep posting updates here until I get <em>The Erasable Man</em> live somewhere.</p>
