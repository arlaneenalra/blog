								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every so often I&#8217;ve found myself wanting to link to a specific comment over on <a href="http://litreactor.com" target="_blank">LitReactor.</a> Unfortunately, while they have in page anchors, there is no easy way to get at a link to them. Having fought with developer tools tracking down the right anchor element one too many times, I decided to throw this little toy together right quick:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate">
javascript:(function () {
    var comment_container = $('#comments');
    var comments = $('div.comment', comment_container);
    var anchors = $('a[id~=comment]', comment_container);

    for (var i = 0; i &lt; anchors.length; i++) {
        var anchor = $(anchors[i]);
        var comment = $(comments[i]);

        var href = window.location.href + '#' + anchor.attr('id');

        $('.comment-content .comment-meta a:first-child ', comment).before(
            '&lt;a href=&quot;' + href + '&quot;&gt; # &lt;/a&gt;'
        );
    }
})();
</pre>
<p>And here it is as a link: <a id="litreactor-bookmarklet" style="display: none;" href="/">LitReactor: Add Comment Links</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind, this is just a toy! No warranties, use at your own risk etc!</p>
<p><script type="text/javascript">// <![CDATA[
jQuery(function($) {   $('#litreactor-bookmarklet').attr('href', "javascript:(function () { var comment_container = $('#comments'); var comments = $('div.comment', comment_container); var anchors = $('a[id~=comment]', comment_container); for (var i = 0; i < anchors.length; i++) { var anchor = $(anchors[i]); var comment = $(comments[i]); var href = window.location.href + '#' + anchor.attr('id'); $('.comment-content .comment-meta a:first-child ', comment).before( '<a href=\"' + href + '\">&nbsp;#&nbsp;</a>'); } })();").show(); });
// ]]&gt;</script></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally!  I&#8217;ve made my way back through the first ten thousand words of <em>The Erasable Man</em> and have finally caught up with where I was when <em><a title="Teleport Us" href="http://litreactor.com/events/8662/submissions" target="_blank">Teleport-Us</a></em> derailed me.  Now, how to get Zachary Artemas out of his little predicament &#8230; but you don&#8217;t know about that do you.  Here&#8217;s a little snippet:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry your little head none about that. I&#8217;m not supposed to kill you unless you&#8217;re difficult,&#8221; said the little man. &#8220;He gave me a note to read to you. It says: Next time it will be you. What&#8217;s that supposed to mean? Next time it will &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Something gurgled and collapsed with a heavy thud. I looked over my shoulder and saw my assailant on the ground, surrounded by dried blood. A zip-tie, pulled tight enough to have embedded itself into the man&#8217;s wrist, bound his hands in the small of his back. Next to the body was a pile of neatly folded skin and two skewered eyeballs sitting on a small ceramic dish pointed directly at me. The eyes had been placed so that they appeared to be looking into my own.</p>
<p>There was no need to check his pulse; the man had been dead for a long time, several hours if the Sun&#8217;s elevation could be trusted. The massive gap in my memory ached like a missing limb. How do you deal with someone who can immobilize you without warning, I thought to myself.</p></blockquote>
<p>The plan is still to release this in an episodic form, with periodic role ups of several episodes.  The main reason I haven&#8217;t pushed out some of the earlier episodes (read that as 2) is that I&#8217;m having trouble finishing them up in a timely manner.  Once I can nail that down, and build up enough of a release backlog to have a spare episode or two waiting in the wings, <em>The Erasable Man</em> will hit the figurative presses.</p>
<p>Anyone have suggestions on a viable platform to publish episodic fiction?</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Late Saturday the 30th, almost the 31st, I finally finished reading the last entry to <a href="http://litreactor.com/events/teleport-us" target="_blank">Teleport Us</a> on <a href="http://litreactor.com/" target="_blank">LitReactor</a>.  Over the course of three months, I&#8217;ve read and commented on around 160 short stories.  I&#8217;m not sure of the exact number as some of the stories were pulled after and some before I could get around to reading them.</p>
<p>There is a sense of elation and accomplishment that comes with completing a run like that, and some withdrawal pangs as you realized it&#8217;s all over.  I can honestly say that this competition has devoured almost all of my free time since it was first announced back in January.  Now that it&#8217;s finished, I will have to get to work on some of my own writing again and back to my sorely neglected reading list.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t get around to reading entries before the April 1st deadline, don&#8217;t worry. <a href="http://litreactor.com/events/scare-us" target="_blank">Scare Us</a> from last year is still online with all the entries and comments that went with them, and I&#8217;m certain that Teleport Us will be left up indefinitely as well.  All you have to do is <a href="http://litreactor.com/user/register" target="_blank">get an account on LitReactor</a> to access all of those amazing and sometimes gruesome stories!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a short list of my favorites with quick links:</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The guys over at <a href="http://litreactor.com" target="_blank">LitReactor</a> have done it again and wiped out another month of writing time.  Of course, that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m not writing, just that I&#8217;m working on a project related to their event <a href="http://litreactor.com/events/teleport-us" target="_blank">Teleport Us</a> rather than other things.</p>
<p>This is the second time I&#8217;ve gone through one of these and I have to say that the four thousand word limit is a killer!  It really forces you to cut down things that aren&#8217;t core to a story.  If you haven&#8217;t been by the site before, give a whirl.  You can find my entry at:</p>
