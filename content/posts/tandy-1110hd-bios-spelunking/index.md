I recently came into possession of an old Tandy 1110HD Laptop, a early 90s era machine with a V.20 cpu, the classic
640k of RAM, a CGA class monochrome reflective LCD display, 720k floppy drive, and a 20mb Conner CP-2024 hard drive.
I grew up around a Radio Shack franchise and actually had one of these machines a very long time ago. I'm reasonably
comfortable around a soldering iron's and test equipment so when I found a couple of these being sold for parts on
Ebay, I decided what the heck and picked them both up.

There are a couple of known issues with this particular machine that I was aware of going into to things:
* The floppy drives fail due to a rotted belt, usually this is correctable with an appropriate replacement.
* The Conner CP-2024 hard drive is known to fail due to a rubber bumper inside the drive that degrades and eventually
  leads to the head being locked in the parked position.
